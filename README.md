>This used to be a fork of [ldn0x7dc/react-native-gallery](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-gallery) but since the author has stopped maintaining it, here's our own repo. Props to him for his work !

A pure JavaScript image gallery component for react-native apps with common gestures like pan, pinch and doubleTap, supporting both iOS and Android.

This component aims to be (one of) the best image viewer for react-native apps. Comparing with other gallery alike components, this one should be more elegant in following aspects: (mimics iOS system photo album app).

* Gesture handle: besides common pan, pinch and doubleTap, this component does well in targeting foucs point( or pivot) when zoom-in and zoom-out.
* Responder switch: the gesture responder switch is more flexible than any other component, that is, the scrollable container and the wrapped image children perform well in acquiring and releasing gesture responder from/to each other.

This component utilizes **[@ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-view-pager)** as the scrollable container and **[react-native-transformable-image](https://github.com/ldn0x7dc/react-native-transformable-image)** as the wrapped image.

This component works on react-native **0.28+**.

You can try this example live in **Archriss' showcase app** on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.archriss.demo.app) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/lu/app/archriss-presentation-mobile/id1180954376?mt=8) or check out the demo.

## Install

`npm install --save react-native-image-gallery` or `yarn add react-native-image-gallery`

## Usage example

```javascript
import Gallery from 'react-native-image-gallery';

  render() {
    return (
      <Gallery
        style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'black' }}
        images={[
          { source: require('yourApp/image.png'), dimensions: { width: 150, height: 150 } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/XP2BE7q.jpg' } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/5nltiUd.jpg' } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/6vOahbP.jpg' } },
          { source: { uri: 'http://i.imgur.com/kj5VXtG.jpg' } }
        ]}
      />
    );
  }
```

## Remote and local images

You can now use either a remote image, by specifying `source.uri`, or a local image where `source` is the result of your `require()`.

**Be aware that you need to pass the dimensions of your local images ! It's still not required for remotes images**, although you can still provide their dimensions to prevent the gallery from fetching their height and width online, which can improve the perfs a bit.

## Scroll state and events

* `onPageScroll` : (event) => {}.

  The event object carries following data:

  * `position`:  index of first page from the left that is currently visible.
  * `offset`: value from range [0,1) describing stage between page transitions.
  * `fraction`: means that (1 - x) fraction of the page at "position" index is visible, and x fraction of the next page is visible.

* `onPageScrollStateChanged` : (state) => {}.

  Called when the page scrolling state has changed. The page scrolling state can be in 3 states:

  * `'idle'`: there is no interaction with the page scroller happening at the time.
  * `'dragging'`: there is currently an interaction with the page scroller.
  * `'settling'`: there was an interaction with the page scroller, and the page scroller is now finishing it's closing or opening animation.
